<p>Welcome to the Garden of Eden! In the garden you can find Adam, the Tree of Knowledge, the tree’s fruit, and the infamous evil snake. 
Adam’s lips are chomping down on the delicious and juicy fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Beside Adam’s lips, the colorful and magical tree
of knowledge places an apple of knowledge into Adam’s mouth. Next to the tree there is another one of it’s magic fruits, a special banana.
Bellow Adam the evil snake is also there whispering evil thoughts and ready to slither around the garden.  </p>

<b>Building the Garden:</b>

3D parts and Per-vertex colors: In the garden there are two different 3D parts: the apple and the banana. The apple consists of a sphere with a tetrahedron stem and the banana consists of a cube with two tetrahedrons. Both the 3D parts use the Math.random() function to have their colors differ at each vertex. Although both the fruits are one color, using Math.random(), the shades of the color vary depending on the vertex, which creates a really beautiful blend. 

Movable sequential joints: In the garden, both the tree and snake contain sequential joints. 

<b>Life in the Garden:</b>

Animation, Distinct kinds of animated, jointed objects: The Tree of Knowledge, Adam’s lips, the banana, and the apple all move continuously in the garden.
