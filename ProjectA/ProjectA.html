       Adam's lips are moving up and down waiting for the apple of wisdom to fall from the magical and colorful Tree of Knowledge. There are a lot of fruit in the garden including a banana, which you can see right next to the Tree of Knowledge. Click and move around the banana with your mouse. The evil snake can move around the garden with your help as well. Click the arrows on your keyboard to move the evil snake around the garden. The snake can also rotate in order to get a better angle on the food he wants. To rotate, click the snake.
